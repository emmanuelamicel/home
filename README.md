# Home

_emmanuelamicel/home_ is my website.

It is a sandbox in which I practice several technologies, frontend or backend. The goal of this project is to progress in the technologies that interest me while writing a readable code by trying some ideas.

## Technologies

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Ideas

For the moment, let's make a simple homepage with a topbar, a photo and a welcome.
Then, I'll try to add:

* My portfolio,
* An authentication system,
* A blog,
* Customizable markdown editor,
* A tierlist generator,
* Something music related,
* Something climbing related,
* Something video games related,
* Pages dedicated to the animated explanation of mathematical formulas,
* Maybe more, we'll see...
